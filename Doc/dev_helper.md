# Dev Helper

## 1) Pipeline Architecture — Strict Path Separation

EventBase is the **exclusive** retrieval path for chat content. The legacy `eventbase_enabled` toggle has been removed — chat history (live and uploaded archive `.jsonl`) is hard-routed through EventBase ingestion + retrieval. Legacy chunking for chat is no longer supported.

### Two pipelines, strict ownership


| Pipeline                      | Content scope                                                                                                                        | Owned collections                                  | Code entry point                                      |
| ------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| **EventBase pipeline**        | Chat history only (live chat + archive`.jsonl`)                                                                                      | `vectfox_eventbase_*`, `vectfox_archiveevent_*`    | `eventbase-workflow.js` → `eventbase-retrieval.js`   |
| **Standard (Chunk) pipeline** | Non-chat content only — Lorebook / World Info, Character Cards, URLs / web pages, custom documents, wiki pages, YouTube transcripts | `vf_lorebook_*`, `vf_document_*`, user collections | `chat-vectorization.js` → `queryAndMergeCollections` |

The two paths never see each other's content. There is no overlap in collection prefixes or content types.

### Key isolation rule (`core/chat-vectorization.js` → `gatherCollectionsToQuery`)

- `vectfox_eventbase_*` → **always** skipped by the standard pipeline (EventBase pipeline owns them exclusively)
- `vectfox_archiveevent_*` → **always** skipped by the standard pipeline (EventBase pipeline owns them exclusively)
- `vectfox_chat_*` — **no longer minted.** The `VECTFOX_CHAT` prefix constant was removed by the 2026-04 cleanup (`plans/executed/delete-dead-chunk-chat-and-temporal-decay.md`), so no code path creates these. The 2026-05 cleanup (`plans/remove-chunk-chat.md`) deleted the last preview-only consumer (`prepareChatContent`). No production user has `vf_chat_*` data — the product shipped EventBase-only for chat. `gatherCollectionsToQuery` has no explicit `vf_chat_*` exclusion (the prefix constant doesn't exist to check against), but the absence is moot.

### Archive Chat History — Two content paths


| Path               | Content Type in UI      | Collection prefix        | Storage format                               | Retrieval                     |
| -------------------- | ------------------------- | -------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| **A — EventBase** | `Chat → Upload` tab    | `vectfox_archiveevent_*` | Event-shaped (same schema as live EventBase) | Phase A (EventBase re-ranker) |
| **B — Chunk**     | `Document` content type | `vectfox_document_*`     | Chunk-shaped                                 | Phase B (standard pipeline)   |

Archive event collections are **not** auto-locked to any chat after ingestion. Users must manually check "Active for current chat" on the collection card to activate retrieval for a given chat.

### Why this matters

Before the toggle removal, `vectfox_eventbase_*` collections could be included in the standard pipeline when EventBase was OFF, causing them to be queried twice per generation: once by the EventBase pipeline (structured event retrieval with dedup-depth) and once by the standard pipeline (raw chunk retrieval). The standard pipeline query was always redundant and could inject duplicate content. With the toggle gone, this class of bug is structurally impossible.

## 2) Extraction Level Location

Extraction levels are defined in: `core/keyword-boost.js`

Exact export name:
`EXTRACTION_LEVELS`

```javascript
export const EXTRACTION_LEVELS = {
    off: {
        label: 'Off',
        description: 'No auto-extraction, only WI trigger keys',
        enabled: false,
    },
    minimal: {
        label: 'Minimal',
        description: 'First 1500 chars, max 5 keywords',
        enabled: true,
        headerSize: 1500,
        minFrequency: 1,
        maxKeywords: 5,
    },
    balanced: {
        label: 'Balanced',
        description: 'First 5000 chars, max 12 keywords',
        enabled: true,
        headerSize: 5000,
        minFrequency: 1,
        maxKeywords: 12,
    },
    aggressive: {
        label: 'Aggressive',
        description: 'Full text scan, max 15 keywords',
        enabled: true,
        headerSize: null, // null = full text
        minFrequency: 1,
        maxKeywords: 15,
    },
};
```

## 3) Default Summarizer Token/Timeout Constants

## 4) EventBase Window Dedup — Fingerprint Cache

### Problem with old approach

`isWindowAlreadyExtracted` used a semantic DB query (`queryCollection(..., 50, ...)`) to check if a window was already extracted. This was:

- Capped at 50 results → missed already-extracted windows if >50 events in DB
- Slow — requires embedding a dummy query + ANN search on every window

### Current approach (O(1), no DB query)

Two-tier storage:


| Tier          | Where                                                              | Shape                          | When built                                                                                  |
| --------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Persisted** | `extension_settings.vectfox.eventbase_extracted_windows[chatUUID]` | Flat`string[]` of fingerprints | Written each time a window is marked;`saveSettingsDebounced()` flushes to disk              |
| **In-memory** | `_windowCacheSet` (module-scope `Map<chatUUID, Set<fingerprint>>`) | `Set<string>` per chat         | Lazily built on first access from the persisted array; mutated in-place on subsequent marks |

The persisted array is what survives a reload. The `Set` is what makes the lookup actually O(1) — `array.includes` would be O(N) and chats with thousands of windows would degrade.

- **Fingerprint format:** sorted source hashes joined by comma, e.g. `"123,456,789"` (built by `windowFingerprint(hashes)`)
- **On extraction:** `markWindowExtracted(sourceHashes, chatUUID)` — adds the fingerprint to both the in-memory Set AND the persisted array, then calls `saveSettingsDebounced()`. Called in `eventbase-workflow.js` after each successful `insertEvents`.
- **On dedup check:** `isWindowAlreadyExtracted(sourceHashes, messageIds, settings, chatUUID)` — async signature (kept for API compat; `messageIds` and `settings` are ignored). Returns `set.has(fp)` from the in-memory Set — synchronous, O(1).
- **Quick-exit check:** `isLastWindowExtracted(messages, windowSize, step, chatUUID, hashFn)` — checks just the *last* window. Windows process tail-to-head in order, so a hit means everything earlier is done too. Avoids building the full window list when nothing needs work. Used as a pre-flight gate before the per-window loop.
- **Cache invalidation:** `clearWindowCacheForChat(chatUUID)` — drops both the in-memory Set entry and the persisted array for one chat. Called when an EventBase collection is deleted, so the next vectorization run starts fresh.
- **Why NOT chat_metadata:** `chat_metadata` is only saved to disk when ST saves the chat (e.g. when a message is generated). Stopping mid-vectorization and reloading Chrome would lose all fingerprints written during that run. `extension_settings` + `saveSettingsDebounced` persists immediately.

### Key files

- `core/eventbase-store.js` — `markWindowExtracted`, `isWindowAlreadyExtracted`, `isLastWindowExtracted`, `clearWindowCacheForChat`, `windowFingerprint`, plus the private `_windowCacheSet` map
- `core/eventbase-workflow.js` — calls `isLastWindowExtracted` as the pre-flight gate, `isWindowAlreadyExtracted` per-window inside the loop, and `markWindowExtracted` after `insertEvents` succeeds

### Migration note

Windows extracted before this fix have no fingerprint in cache. First run after update will attempt to re-insert them — both backends are idempotent on `hash`: Qdrant overwrites same-ID points and Vectra's plugin upserts by hash, so no duplicates are created. All future runs use the cache correctly.

## 5) GUI Settings — Tab Placement & EventBase Relevance

After the Phase 2 GUI reorg, settings are grouped by which path consumes them:


| Setting                                                                                  | UI tab                       | EventBase relevant? | What it actually does                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------ | --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Insert Batch Size** (default 50)                                                       | ChunkBase → Ingestion       | **No**              | Controls chunks-per-API-call during chunk vectorization. EventBase inserts tiny batches (2–10 events per window) so this has no meaningful effect on EventBase.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| **Dedup Depth** (default 50 messages)                                                    | Core                         | **Yes**             | Used in`eventbase-retrieval.js` as `settings.deduplication_depth`. Filters out retrieved events whose source window falls within the last N messages of the current chat — avoids injecting content already visible in context. 0 = disabled. Also used by chunk-path retrieval in `chat-vectorization.js`.                                                                                                      |
| **Hybrid Search & BM25 block** (Keyword Scoring Method, BM25 k1/b, Fusion Method, RRF K) | Core → Hybrid Search & BM25 | **A1/A2 only**      | These are Vectra (Standard backend) controls. On Qdrant, hybrid is always A3 server-side native — k1/b/RRF K are managed by Qdrant's`modifier: idf` and the `fusion: rrf` API, and these UI knobs have no effect. EventBase callers inject `ebSettings` with `keyword_scoring_method` overridden from `eventbase_keyword_scoring_method` (internal, defaults `'bm25'`, not in UI). See §13 for the full matrix. |
| **Query Keyword Budget** (`hybrid_keyword_level`)                                        | ChunkBase → Keyword Budget  | **No**              | Read only by`scoreResults()` (A1) and `hybridSearch()` (A2). A3 doesn't use it — the sparse-vector encoder tokenizes the full query and Qdrant handles IDF weighting. EventBase has its own importance/persist/recency re-ranker that dominates the final order anyway.                                                                                                                                          |

## 6) Similharity Plugin Speedup (Simultaneous Embedding Requests)

Plugin file changed: `../similharity/index.js`

What we changed:

- In `getVectorsForSource(...)`, API/network providers now run embedding calls in parallel using `Promise.all(...)`.
- Parallel provider set:
  - `vllm`
  - `openrouter`
- Local GPU providers remain sequential to avoid contention/queueing/OOM behavior:
  - `transformers`
  - `ollama`
  - `llamacpp`
  - `koboldcpp`

Why this speeds up:

- Before: one request embedding N items sequentially, total about N x T.
- After (API providers): N requests fired concurrently inside one batch, total about T (subject to upstream limits).

Related client-side behavior (vectfox):

- In `core/core-vector-api.js`, local GPU sources default to small batch behavior unless user explicitly overrides `insert_batch_size`.

## 7) Module Integration Analysis — EventBase Compatibility

Analysis of whether non-EventBase modules should be integrated into the EventBase pipeline.

### temporal-decay.js — DELETED

The whole `core/temporal-decay.js` subsystem (and `tests/temporal-decay.test.js`) was removed. It only operated on chunks with `metadata.source === 'chat'` — a stamp produced exclusively by the legacy chunk-based chat path that EventBase replaced. EventBase events never carried that stamp, so the subsystem was unreachable from the EventBase pipeline. Recency on the EventBase side is — and always was — handled by the `_recencyBonus` term inside the 4-weight re-ranker formula in [`eventbase-store.js`](core/eventbase-store.js) (computed from `source_window_end` and `chatLength`). Mentioned here only because the rest of this document used to cross-reference the old module.

### hybrid-search.js — Used indirectly (do not wire directly)

**Module:** [`core/hybrid-search.js`](core/hybrid-search.js)
**Decision:** ✅ EventBase benefits from it — but through `queryCollection()`, not by direct call.

EventBase calls `queryEvents()` → `queryCollection()` (via an `ebSettings` shim that pins `keyword_scoring_method` to `eventbase_keyword_scoring_method || 'bm25'`). Inside `queryCollection()`, the A1/A2/A3 routing decides whether to invoke `clientSideHybridSearch()` (A2) or the backend's native hybrid (A3, `backend.hybridQuery()`). On Standard backend, EventBase is always A1 unless `eventbase_keyword_scoring_method` is explicitly set to `'hybrid'`. On Qdrant, A3 (native sparse + server-side RRF) is the **only** hybrid path — the previous user-toggle was removed after the A/B/C testing picked native_rrf as the winner. `hybrid_native_prefer` remains as a hidden settings.json escape hatch (default `true`) for testing A2 without UI.

Do **not** call `hybridSearch()` directly from `eventbase-retrieval.js` or `eventbase-workflow.js`. It operates at the backend/collection layer — returns raw `{ hashes, metadata }` and bypasses `queryEvents()`, the store schema hydration, and EventBase-specific field population (`score`, `importance`, etc.).

### Summary table


| Module                                      | Add directly to EventBase? | Reason                                                                                                                                              |
| --------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `core/temporal-decay.js`                    | n/a — module deleted      | Subsystem only fired on`source: 'chat'` chunks (legacy chunk path). Recency on EventBase is handled by `_recencyBonus` inside the 4-weight formula. |
| [`hybrid-search.js`](core/hybrid-search.js) | No (used indirectly)       | EventBase inherits A2/A3 hybrid automatically via`queryCollection()`. Direct calls would bypass `queryEvents()` and the store layer.                |

---

## 8) Retrieval Paths — A1 / A2 / A3 Comparison

Three retrieval paths exist. The path is chosen automatically inside `queryCollection()` based on (a) backend and (b) `keyword_scoring_method`. EventBase, ChunkBase, and the Query Tester all flow through this same dispatch.

### ⚠️ Standard backend: vectorScore depends on whether Similharity is installed

What `vectorScore` looks like on standard backend depends on whether the **Similharity plugin** is available — see §15 for the plugin-dependency policy. Two paths, two behaviours:

| Path | When | What `vectorScore` looks like |
|---|---|---|
| **Plugin-enhanced** | `StandardBackend.pluginAvailable === true` (the common case once the plugin is installed) | Real cosine values come back via `/api/plugins/similharity/chunks/query`. Scores are usable for A2's fusion math. |
| **Degraded (no plugin)** | Fresh ST install without the optional plugin, or `pluginAvailable` forced `false` (TEST 009 scenario) | ST's native `/api/vector/query` computes cosine internally but **strips the scores from the response before returning**. VectFox receives only hashes and text — every `vectorScore` is `0.0000`. Hard ST-upstream limitation. |

The path is picked inside `StandardBackend.queryCollection` based on the runtime `pluginAvailable` flag; A1/A2 path selection itself is unchanged.

#### Plugin-enhanced path (the default)

- **A1 (BM25 re-rank)**: re-ranks the plugin-returned candidates by BM25. `vectorScore` from the plugin is *available* but A1 ignores it by design — BM25 alone drives the ranking.
- **A2 (client-side hybrid RRF)**: gets a real `vectorScore` per candidate and fuses it with BM25 via RRF (or weighted fusion). This is the same shape as A3 conceptually, just with the fusion happening in JS instead of Qdrant. A2 is meaningfully better than A1 on the plugin-enhanced path because the vector signal is real.

#### Degraded path (no plugin)

The historical "always-zero vectorScore" behavior. Both A1 and A2 still work, but they degrade differently:

- **Effect on A1 (BM25 re-rank):** No impact. A1 ignores `vectorScore` entirely and re-ranks the candidate set using BM25 alone. ST's internal similarity still controls *which* candidates come back; A1 just ignores the ordering ST applied to them.
- **Effect on A2 (client-side hybrid RRF):** A2 cannot use `vectorScore` for fusion (it's always 0), so it falls back to using ST's **rank ordering** as the vector signal instead — via the RRF formula `1 / (k + vectorRank)`. This means:
  - A result that ST placed at rank 1 gets a small RRF boost even with no BM25 match.
  - A result with a BM25 match but weak vector rank gets a small RRF penalty compared to A1.
  - Results with no BM25 match AND weak vector rank score only `rrfRankFactor × 0.25` (very low).
  - Text-only matches (BM25 > 0, vectorScore = 0) are penalized by a ×0.60 multiplier in hybrid-search.js.

**Practical difference between A1 and A2 — degraded path only:**


|                               | A1 (BM25 re-rank)    | A2 (client-side RRF)                                        |
| ------------------------------- | ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Uses ST's similarity ordering | ❌ — discarded      | ✅ — used as`vectorRank` in RRF                            |
| Uses BM25 scores              | ✅ — primary signal | ✅ — secondary signal, penalized ×0.60 if no vector match |
| Penalty on BM25 matches       | None                 | ×0.60 (text-only path)                                     |
| Results with zero BM25 match  | Score = 0, dropped   | Score =`0.25 × rrfRankFactor` — may still appear          |
| Predictability                | High                 | Lower — rank-based fusion is noisy without real scores     |

**When does the A1/A2 difference matter on the degraded path?**

- **Semantic queries (no keyword overlap):** A1 scores everything 0 — results fall back to arbitrary ordering. A2 uses ST's `vectorRank` as a fallback signal via RRF, preserving ST's internal semantic ordering even without scores. A2 degrades more gracefully here.
- **Keyword queries (BM25 matches exist):** Both paths rank primarily by BM25. A2 adds `vectorRank` as a secondary tie-breaker for results with equal BM25 scores. The ×0.60 penalty is applied uniformly to all results and does not change their relative order — it only affects absolute score values.
- **Score threshold sensitivity:** The ×0.60 penalty lowers all A2 absolute scores. If `score_threshold` is set above zero, A2 may filter out results that A1 would keep. With the default `score_threshold=0` this is not an issue.

#### Recommendation (consolidated)

| User's setup | Best path | Why |
|---|---|---|
| **Standard + plugin installed** (common) | A2 (Hybrid) | Real `vectorScore` + BM25 fusion. Meaningfully better than A1, not just marginally. |
| **Standard + no plugin** (degraded) | A2 (Hybrid) is still slightly better | A2 uses ST's rank ordering as a fallback signal; A1 ignores it entirely. The plugin-vs-no-plugin gap is much larger than the A1-vs-A2 gap here. |
| **Qdrant** | A3 (native sparse + server-side RRF) | The only hybrid path on Qdrant; full corpus IDF, sparse vector retrieval, no rank-based fallbacks. |

A1 still has one use case on either standard path: simpler, more predictable scoring for debugging threshold behaviour or isolating the BM25 signal.

### ⚠️ "Corpus-wide IDF" is NOT "Corpus-wide search"

The `bm25_use_corpus_idf` toggle is the source of the most common misconception. It is worth being explicit:


| Question                                                                   | Answer                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Does ON make BM25 score all chunks in the collection?                      | **No.** BM25 still only scores the ANN top-K candidates the vector layer surfaced.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| What does ON actually change?                                              | The**IDF weights** used for the per-query terms. With ON, IDF is computed from corpus-wide df values (e.g. `df(贖身)=5 / N=1394`). With OFF, df is recomputed per query against just the local candidate set (e.g. `df(贖身)=3 / N=40`) — which biases IDF toward zero whenever the candidates already share the term. |
| How can a doc that doesn't appear in the ANN top-K still affect the score? | It can't be a result. It can only contribute to global df values, which feed into the per-term IDF weights of docs that*are* in the candidate set.                                                                                                                                                                      |
| What if I want true full-corpus retrieval (find docs that vector missed)?  | Use**A3 (Qdrant)**. Only that path stores a sparse-vector index over every chunk and can match by term across the full collection. The standard backend has no inverted/sparse index.                                                                                                                                   |

So `bm25_use_corpus_idf` should be read as: *"Use corpus df values when computing IDF weights for the candidates BM25 is already scoring."* The toggle improves **scoring quality** within the existing recall window; it does **not** widen the recall window.

#### Why default ON

For typical 1-2k-chunk collections, cold build is sub-second and main-thread freeze is under 300 ms — imperceptible. Steady-state cost is one Map lookup per query token. The ranking benefit is small when EventBase's importance/persist post-rank dominates the score, but the cost is small enough that "default ON" is the right call. Users with very large collections (>10k chunks) where the build starts to bite can flip it off; the scaling threshold and mitigation options (yield-in-loop / Web Worker / server-side df) are noted in the corpus-stats.js header.

### Path selection (decision tree)

```
backend == 'qdrant' ?
  ├─ yes → hybrid_native_prefer !== false (default true) ?
  │         ├─ yes → A3
  │         └─ no  → keyword_scoring_method == 'hybrid' ? A2 : A1
  └─ no (standard/vectra) → keyword_scoring_method == 'hybrid' ? A2 : A1
```

EventBase overrides `keyword_scoring_method` with `eventbase_keyword_scoring_method` (default `'bm25'`) before dispatch, so for EventBase on Standard backend the default is **A1**, not A2.

### Native Formula Rerank (A3 + Qdrant ≥ 1.13)

When `eventbase_native_rerank = true`, `_runOneLiveQuery()` in
[core/eventbase-retrieval.js](../core/eventbase-retrieval.js) calls
`backend.hybridQueryWithRerank()` instead of `backend.hybridQuery()`. This
issues a single Qdrant `/points/query` with the four-weight formula baked in:

```json
{
  "prefetch": [
    { "query": "<denseVector>", "limit": "<prefetchLimit>" },
    { "query": "<sparseVector>", "using": "text_sparse", "limit": "<prefetchLimit>" }
  ],
  "query": {
    "formula": {
      "sum": [
        { "mult": [0.55, { "mult": [1.0, "$score"] }] },
        { "mult": [0.20, { "div": { "left": "importance", "right": 10 } }] },
        { "mult": [0.15, { "key": "should_persist", "match": { "value": true } }] },
        { "mult": [0.10, { "exp_decay": { "x": "source_window_end", "target": "<chatLength>", "scale": "<halfLife>", "midpoint": 0.5 } }] }
      ]
    }
  },
  "filter": { "must_not": [{ "key": "type", "match": { "value": "_vectfox_meta" } }] },
  "limit": "<topK>"
}
```

`$score` is Qdrant's RRF fusion score (peaks at 1.0 when k=1 internally).
The prefetch pool is `prefetchLimit` events (default: `topK × 3`), giving the
formula access to a wider candidate set than the plain RRF top-K — this lets
high-importance/high-recency events that ranked outside the top-K in plain RRF
still surface in the final result.

**What stays client-side even in 6a:**

- **Anchor boost** — multi-token phrase substring match (e.g. `贖身的儀式`)
  requires JS; Qdrant tokenizes terms individually and any-of matching would
  miss phrases.
- **Pairwise deduplication** — content-hash overlap across events.
- **Cross-collection merge** — `Promise.all` per collection, concat-dedup-trim.

**Version requirement:** Qdrant ≥ 1.13 for `formula` query support. If the
request fails with a Qdrant error, check the server version and set
`eventbase_native_rerank = false` to fall back to the JS path.

## 11) Hybrid Search & BM25 — GUI Placement Matrix

Backend determines path; on Qdrant there is only one hybrid path (A3). On Standard, the user picks A1 vs A2.

- **ChunkBase** owns non-chat content only: Lorebook / World Info, Character Cards, URLs / web pages, custom documents, wiki pages, YouTube transcripts. Uses `keyword_scoring_method`.
- **EventBase** owns chat content only: Current Chat history and uploaded Archive Chat history (`.jsonl`). Uses `eventbase_keyword_scoring_method` (internal, not in UI, defaults `'bm25'`).

Both paths call `queryCollection()` but EventBase callers (`eventbase-retrieval.js`, `eventbase-workflow.js`, `eventbase-store.js`) always inject an `ebSettings` shim:

```js
const ebSettings = { ...settings, keyword_scoring_method: settings.eventbase_keyword_scoring_method || 'bm25' };
```

This ensures ChunkBase's `keyword_scoring_method` never leaks into EventBase queries.

Flip to `false` via settings.json to force Qdrant onto A2 for testing. No UI. |

### Key observations

1. **Qdrant has exactly one hybrid path — A3.** The A/B/C testing in [plans/qdrant-native-sparse-hybrid-rrf.md](../plans/qdrant-native-sparse-hybrid-rrf.md) picked native sparse + native RRF as the winner; the dropdown and the "Prefer Native Backend Hybrid" checkbox were both removed. A3 runs entirely server-side via Qdrant's `/points/query` endpoint with `prefetch: [dense, sparse]` and `fusion: "rrf"`.
2. **A3 uses globally-accurate IDF.** Qdrant's `modifier: "idf"` computes IDF over the true full corpus (every indexed document), not the ANN-bounded subset. This eliminates the BM25 IDF bias that A1 and A2 carry.
3. **Path routing is content-type-scoped.** ChunkBase's `keyword_scoring_method` no longer affects EventBase. Changing to "Hybrid" in ChunkBase tab only switches lorebook queries.
4. **Sparse vectors are tokenizer-locked.** The CJK tokenizer mode at upsert is baked into a sentinel metadata point on each Qdrant collection. Querying after a mode change shows a modal asking the user to revert or re-vectorize.
5. **A1/A2 quality on Standard depends on the Similharity plugin.** With the plugin installed (the common case), Standard backend gets real `vectorScore` values back, so A2 fuses dense + BM25 like a "lite A3". Without the plugin, ST's native `/api/vector/query` strips scores → A2 falls back to rank-based fusion. The path selection doesn't change, but the fusion quality does. See §15 (plugin dependency policy) and §8 ("vectorScore depends on whether Similharity is installed") for the full split.

### GUI hide/show rules


| Backend                        | Visible in Core                                                                                                                                   | Visible in ChunkBase   |
| -------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------ |
| **Qdrant** (A3 — only option) | Native-active notice + CJK Tokenizer Mode dropdown (Keyword Extraction subsection).**Fusion Method and RRF K are hidden** — Qdrant ignores them. | *(no hybrid controls)* |
| **Standard + BM25** (A1)       | Keyword Scoring Method, BM25 k1, BM25 b                                                                                                           | Query Keyword Budget   |
| **Standard + Hybrid** (A2)     | Keyword Scoring Method, BM25 k1, BM25 b, Fusion Method, RRF K                                                                                     | *(no hybrid controls)* |

Notes:

- "Prefer Native Backend Hybrid" checkbox was removed. The setting `hybrid_native_prefer` still exists in defaults (`true`) as an escape hatch for testing A2 against Qdrant without UI.
- Fusion Method and RRF K Constant are hidden on Qdrant because Qdrant runs `fusion: "rrf"` server-side with its own internal k constant; exposing the controls would be misleading. They reappear when the user switches `vector_backend` to Standard (where A2 actually uses them).
- The CJK Tokenizer Mode dropdown lives in the Keyword Extraction subsection (always visible). It's the **only** Hybrid Search & BM25 control that affects A3 — it drives the sparse-vector encoder.
- Visibility is driven by [`updateNativeHybridUI()`](../ui/ui-manager.js) which fires on changes to `vector_backend` and `keyword_scoring_method`. On Qdrant it always shows the Native-active notice (no toggle).

### Server-side hybrid fusion — yes, fully supported

A3 leverages **all four** of Qdrant's relevant server-side features:

## 12) Trigger / Condition Activation — English Only

Activation Triggers and Advanced Conditions (Collection Settings → Activation panel) are **English-only**. They do not work reliably for CJK (Chinese / Japanese / Korean) stories.

### Why

**Triggers** match keywords against recent messages using JavaScript `String.includes()` and `/\b.../` regex anchors. `\b` is an ASCII word-boundary — it does not fire between CJK characters, so regex triggers will never match CJK text. Plain-string triggers (`includes()`) technically match substrings, but CJK chat messages lack the whitespace separators that make keyword matching useful, so hit rates are extremely low.

**Advanced Conditions → Emotion** relies on two detection paths, both English-only:

1. **Character Expressions classifier (primary)**: The sprite classification model bundled with the Character Expressions SillyTavern extension is trained on English text. CJK input produces unreliable or random emotion labels.
2. **`EMOTION_KEYWORDS` fallback (secondary)**: Defined in `core/conditional-activation.js` → `EMOTION_KEYWORDS`. Every entry is an English word or English regex pattern (e.g. `joy: ['joy', 'happy', 'smile', '/\\b(grin|beam)\\w*/i']`). Zero CJK coverage.

**Advanced Conditions → Message Contains / Pattern** also use `includes()` / regex with `\b` anchors — same limitation as Triggers.

### What works for CJK

- **Active for current chat / Character lock** (manual always-on) — no language dependency.
- **Advanced Conditions → Message Count / Turn Count** — purely numeric, language-independent.

### If CJK keyword matching is needed

Add CJK terms to `EMOTION_KEYWORDS` in `core/conditional-activation.js`, or extend `matchesEmotionPatterns()` to use `\p{L}` Unicode word boundaries (requires the `u` flag on the regex). Neither is implemented as of 2026-05-11.

## 13) AgentMode — Agentic Retrieval

Optional LLM-planner step that runs between EventBase pre-search and re-rank. Sees the pre-search candidates plus recent chat context, then fans out 1-4 follow-up queries in parallel against Qdrant. **Purely additive — never replaces the existing flow.** A3 (Qdrant) only.

### Flow

```
retrieveEventsWithAgent(params)
 ├─ STAGE 1 — retrieveEvents(params)              (existing pre-search, unchanged)
 ├─ STAGE 2 — early-exit if disabled or non-Qdrant → return pre-search
 ├─ STAGE 3 — _callPlanner({system, user, llmCfg, timeoutMs})
 │    LLM input: recent N turns + current user message + top-K candidate summaries
 │    LLM output: { queries: string[], filters?: {...}, rationale: string }
 ├─ STAGE 4 — Promise.all of queryCollection per (collection × planner-query)
 └─ STAGE 5 — retrieveEvents({skipLiveQuery: true, additionalCandidates: [...]})
              re-runs 4-weight rerank / dedup / context-dedup / top-K trim
```

### Phase 1 limitations (intentional)

- **Planner-emitted filters are NOT applied** to queries yet. The planner may emit `characters_any`, `concepts_any`, `importance_gte` etc. in its JSON output, but the agentic-retrieval module ignores those fields and runs unfiltered hybrid search. Phase 1.5 will extend Similharity's [`_buildHybridFilter`](../../similharity/qdrant-backend.js) to translate the `*_any` shape into Qdrant `should` clauses.

### Settings (all in `index.js` defaults)

```js
agentic_retrieval_enabled                false       // master toggle
agentic_retrieval_provider               ''          // '' → inherit summarize_provider
agentic_retrieval_model                  ''          // '' → inherit summarize_model
agentic_retrieval_openrouter_api_key     ''          // '' → inherit summarize_openrouter_api_key
agentic_retrieval_vllm_url               ''          // '' → inherit summarize_vllm_url
agentic_retrieval_vllm_api_key           ''          // '' → inherit summarize_vllm_api_key
agentic_retrieval_chat_depth             5           // slider 3-15
agentic_retrieval_candidates_to_show     12          // slider 5-20
agentic_retrieval_max_queries            4           // slider 1-4
agentic_retrieval_timeout_ms             30000       // hard timeout for planner call (matches summarize default)
agentic_retrieval_debug_logging          false       // separate from eventbase_debug_logging
```

Inheritance is centralized in `_resolveAgenticLLMConfig(settings)` — read it once, no scattered `||` checks elsewhere.

### Debug log shape (when `agentic_retrieval_debug_logging` is true)

All lines prefixed `[vectfoxPlus-Agentic]` so they're greppable and distinct from `[EventBase]` / `[Qdrant]`.

Per retrieval round emits, in order:

1. `mode=ON trigger=user_message_len=<N>`
2. `Pre-search returned <N> candidates (top score=<x.xx>)`
3. `Past chat turns sent to planner: <depth>`
4. `Narrative context preview` — one ~50-word snippet per turn (matches what the planner actually sees, and the count equals `agentic_retrieval_chat_depth`)
5. `LLM prompt size: system+user approx <T> tokens (<a>+<b> chars)` — size only, not the prompt text (it's noisy and the static system prompt is already in `core/agentic-prompt.js`; the narrative-context preview at step 4 already shows the dynamic part)
6. `LLM call complete: <ms>ms`
7. `Planner output:` followed by the full JSON response from the LLM (queries, filters, rationale)
8. `Qdrant fanout: <N> queries × <M> collections = <X> parallel calls`
9. `Qdrant fanout complete: <ms>ms`
10. `Per-query hits:` — one line per query with top score
11. `Agentic-only hits (not already in pre-search): <N>`
12. `Final merged candidates: <pre> + <agentic> = <total> → <final> after rerank/dedup/trim`
13. `Total wall-clock for agent overhead: <ms>ms (LLM=<ms>ms, fanout=<ms>ms)`

Timing buckets:

- LLM call ms (measured around `_callPlanner`)
- Qdrant fanout ms (measured around the `Promise.all` of `queryCollection` calls)
- Total agent overhead ms (measured from agent-stage entry through stage 5 return)
- Embedding batch ms — implicit inside each `queryCollection` call; not separately timed in Phase 1

### Failure modes — all fall back to pre-search


| Failure                                                          | Outcome                                                                     |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `agentic_retrieval_enabled = false`                              | Skip stages 2-5; identical to today                                         |
| `vector_backend !== 'qdrant'`                                    | Skip; log`mode=SKIPPED reason=requires_qdrant_backend`                      |
| Missing model or API key                                         | Skip; log`mode=SKIPPED reason=missing_model` / `missing_openrouter_api_key` |
| Planner LLM throws / times out / returns invalid JSON            | Log warn; return pre-search only                                            |
| Planner returns 0 valid queries (after`_validateAndTrimQueries`) | Log; return pre-search only                                                 |
| One of N Qdrant queries fails                                    | Per-promise`.catch(err) → []`; other queries still merge                   |
| All Qdrant queries fail                                          | `agenticHits = []`; pre-search events still feed stage 5 re-rank            |
| `liveCollectionIds` empty                                        | Skip stages 4-5; return pre-search                                          |

**Invariant:** AgentMode MUST NEVER produce a worse result than today's flow. The drop-in shape of `retrieveEventsWithAgent` is designed so that on any failure the return value is exactly what `retrieveEvents` would have returned.

### Debug return shape

When AgentMode runs successfully, the returned `debug` object gains:

```js
{
  agenticMode: true,
  agenticQueries: string[],     // validated planner queries that actually ran
  agenticRationale: string,     // planner's one-sentence rationale (for diagnostics)
  agenticLLMMs: number,
  agenticFanoutMs: number,
  agenticTotalMs: number,
  agenticHitCount: number,      // events the agentic stage contributed before merge/rerank
}
```

Use these fields in future benchmark / diagnostic tooling.

**See [Doc/collection_helper.md](./collection_helper.md).**

Originally lived inline as a 400-line section here. It outgrew the surrounding doc and was split out 2026-05-23 so the rest of `dev_helper.md` stays scannable. Everything related to collection listing, lock state, registry-key construction, backend routing for queries, and the UI checkboxes that mirror lock state is in that file.

If you are about to write code that:

- registers or looks up a collection
- reads or mutates a lock (chat or character)
- queries or deletes vectors for a specific collection
- decides which backend to route a query through
- builds the `backend:collectionId` storage key

…open `collection_helper.md` first. Every helper has been reimplemented inline at least once with subtly wrong behavior; the doc lists which functions to import instead.

## 15) Similharity Plugin — Dependency Policy

The Similharity plugin (`/api/plugins/similharity/*`) was built for Qdrant. Its relationship with the standard backend follows strict rules.

### Rule: plugin is Qdrant-native, optional-only on standard


| Backend               | Plugin role                                                                          |
| ----------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Qdrant**            | Required. All inserts, queries, chunk listing, and management go through the plugin. |
| **Standard (Vectra)** | Optional enhancement only. Standard backend must be fully functional without it.     |

### Standard backend — what the plugin enhances (when installed)


| Feature                       | Without plugin             | With plugin                                                                |
| ------------------------------- | ---------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Insert / write                | Native`/api/vector/insert` | Plugin`/chunks/insert` — adds metadata (keywords, importance, conditions) |
| Query / read                  | Native`/api/vector/query`  | Plugin`/chunks/query` — returns metadata alongside results                |
| Chunk listing (View Chunks)   | Not possible               | Plugin`/chunks/list` — full text + metadata                               |
| Chunk editing (text/metadata) | Not possible               | Plugin`/chunks/{hash}/text` + `/metadata`                                  |
| Stats                         | Hash count only            | Plugin`/chunks/stats` — rich stats                                        |
| Collection discovery          | Registry only              | Plugin`/collections` — filesystem scan                                    |

### The rule for new code

- **Standard backend (`backends/standard.js`):** Every plugin call MUST be gated by `this.pluginAvailable`. Every gated call MUST have a native-API fallback. No unconditional plugin calls.
- **UI and core modules (outside `backends/`):** Check `browserState.pluginAvailable` (UI) or make an explicit health check before calling plugin endpoints. Show a graceful message if unavailable — never throw an unhandled error.
- **Import/export (`core/collection-export.js`):** `insertChunksWithVectors` uses native `/api/vector/insert` for standard backend unconditionally — plugin is never called for inserts on standard backend regardless of plugin availability. This is intentional: the plugin insert path was originally there by mistake.

### Why the separation matters

Using the plugin for standard backend inserts created a hidden dependency: users without the plugin couldn't import collections. The native ST API supports pre-computed vector inserts via an `embeddings` map — there is no reason to route standard backend inserts through the plugin. The plugin's value on standard backend is read-side enhancement (metadata retrieval, chunk listing), not write-side.

### Test-suite coverage matrix — which tests run in which configuration?

The `tests/Eventbase-test.spec.js` suite runs against a live ST instance. Each test has a different relationship with the plugin and the qdrant backend. Tests that can't run on the current environment **soft-skip** (marked ⏭️ in the Playwright report via `test.skip(...)`) rather than failing — this is critical because the suite runs in **serial mode**, and a hard FAIL would halt every subsequent test. A no-plugin user running the full suite would otherwise be stuck at TEST 001 and never reach the standard-backend tests that DO work on their machine.

Three environment requirements to consider:

VectFox runs in **three distinct deployment environments**. Each unlocks a different subset of features and exercises a different code path. The test suite soft-skips tests that aren't applicable to the current environment so users on any of the three setups get a clean `npm run test:e2e` run.

### The 3 environments

| # | Environment | Plugin probe | Qdrant config | Backend in use | Who runs this |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **1** | **No plugin** | `/api/plugins/similharity/health` returns no-plugin (no JSON) | — | Standard (vectra), degraded — native ST API only | Fresh ST install. The "minimum viable" deployment. |
| **2** | **Plugin, no qdrant** | `/health` returns `{status: 'ok'}` | `qdrant_url`/`qdrant_host` empty | Standard (vectra), plugin-enhanced | User installed the Similharity plugin for richer metadata/scores but doesn't run Qdrant. |
| **3** | **Plugin + qdrant** | `/health` returns `{status: 'ok'}` | `qdrant_url` or `qdrant_host` set, qdrant reachable | Qdrant (full A3 hybrid path) | Full production deployment with the entire feature set. |

| **Totals** | | **6 passed, 9 skipped** | **7 passed, 8 skipped** | **15 passed, 0 skipped** |

### Skip logic that drives the matrix

| Helper | Used by | Skip condition |
|---|---|---|
| `skipIfQdrantUnavailable()` | TEST 001-004, 010-013 | (a) Plugin probe fails, **or** (b) `qdrant_url`/`qdrant_host` not set in `extension_settings.vectfox`, **or** (c) qdrant config is set but qdrant is unreachable (emits a **WARNING** in the skip reason). |
| `skipIfNoPlugin()` | TEST 008 only | Plugin probe fails. |
| (none) | TEST 005-007, 009, 014, 015 | These run in every environment. TEST 014 and TEST 015 are pure-function (operate on the window fingerprint cache and the auto-sync start marker in `extension_settings`, respectively) — neither needs the plugin nor any backend. They form the two-layer auto-sync safety coverage: 014 covers the same-window-size dedup, 015 covers the window-size-change marker filter. See [collection_helper.md → Chat Auto-Sync](collection_helper.md) for the contract. |

**The unreachable-qdrant case** (config present but server down) is a soft skip with a WARNING-flavored reason, NOT a hard failure. The reasoning:

- A common case-2 user installed qdrant once, took it down, kept the VectFox settings. They're now a pure standard-backend user.
- Hard-failing qdrant tests for these users would be confusing — nothing is "wrong" with their environment, they just don't use qdrant.
- Serial mode means one hard failure halts the rest of the suite — exactly what we don't want for a user who'd benefit from TEST 005/006/007/008/009 all passing.

If qdrant **is** actually broken (down for the wrong reason) and the user **does** care, the WARNING in the skip log is the signal. The plugin probe (`/health`) and qdrant probe (`/backend/init/qdrant`) are independent — the test framework lets the user know which gate they failed.

### Reading the matrix

- **✅** = the test exercises real code and asserts behavior.
- **"plugin enhances"** = test runs identically whether plugin is present or not, but the plugin upgrades the underlying code path (real `vectorScore` and metadata round-trip instead of degraded native fallback — see §8).
- **TEST 008's "no plugin → skip"** is by design: this test specifically validates the plugin-enhanced standard backend path. The no-plugin counterpart is TEST 009.
- **TEST 009 runs everywhere** because it forces `pluginAvailable = false` on the shared backend instance regardless of whether the plugin is actually installed. This guarantees no-plugin code-path coverage even on a fully-equipped dev machine.

**Critical insight (2026-05-24):** TEST 005/006/007 are **not** "plugin optional" in the sense of "if plugin missing, skip." They run end-to-end on case 1 (no plugin) too — and they're the regression gate that caught the no-plugin scope-resolution bug. See the case study below.

### Why this coverage matters — case study (2026-05-24)

When a no-plugin user reported "I can't lock a collection — the checkbox doesn't stick," the root cause was a 3-line chain:

1. `defaultCollectionMeta.scope = 'unknown'` (the string, not falsy)
2. `getCollectionMeta` returns the default object when no stored meta exists (no-plugin discovery path doesn't pre-stamp scope)
3. `storedMeta.scope || parsedMeta.scope` at [collection-loader.js:1007](../core/collection-loader.js#L1007) — `'unknown'` is truthy → OR short-circuits → correctly-parsed `'chat'` is ignored → `saveActivation` has no branch for `scope='unknown'` → silent no-op on the lock write.

With-plugin users didn't hit this because the plugin's discovery path pre-stamps proper scope before `getCollectionMeta` ever returns the default. The bug was strictly no-plugin. It existed for an extended period without surfacing because no test exercised "no-plugin user clicks the lock checkbox."

TEST 005 caught it the moment it started running on a no-plugin machine (the dry-run query returned 0 entries because the collection wasn't actually locked). This is exactly the value proposition of broad no-plugin coverage.

Fix landed 2026-05-24: default changed to `null`, with a defensive `!== 'unknown'` check at the load site for legacy collections that already have `'unknown'` saved on disk.

**Skip mechanism:**
- Spec-level `test.skip(condition, reason)` in [tests/Eventbase-test.spec.js](../tests/Eventbase-test.spec.js) — uses helpers `skipIfQdrantUnavailable()` and `skipIfNoPlugin()`. Marks the test ⏭️ in the Playwright report.
- In-eval defensive checks emit `[SKIP]` log lines that `assertPassed()` treats as soft-pass (no `[FAIL]`, no `[PASS]` required). Belt-and-suspenders for any case where the spec-level check doesn't fire.
- Plugin probe is cached per-page so the suite doesn't hit `/api/plugins/similharity/probe` more than once.

## 16) Known Pending Cleanups

### 16.1 ChunkBase phase early-gate — broaden vs current  (mainly performance issue, spending 20ms unnecessarily)

**Status**: Deferred — investigated 2026-05-17, no code change yet.

`rearrangeChat` ([core/chat-vectorization.js:1193](../core/chat-vectorization.js#L1193)) runs **EventBase Phase A** then unconditionally falls through to **ChunkBase Phase B**. Phase B has two existing gates:

1. **Early (cheap)** at [line 1247-1240](../core/chat-vectorization.js#L1247): `hasCollections = gatherCollectionsToQuery(settings).length > 0` — passes if *any* non-EventBase collection has `enabled=true`. No lock/scope/activation check.
2. **Post-activation (expensive)** at [line 1295](../core/chat-vectorization.js#L1295): `filterActiveCollections` runs the full [`shouldCollectionActivate`](../core/collection-metadata.js#L1080) priority chain (triggers → conditions → chat lock → character lock).

EventBase-only users (the typical case) hit gate 1 and short-circuit — debug log `[VECTFOX ChunkBase] No enabled ChunkBase collections ...` fires once per generation to confirm.

**What was considered**: tightening the early gate so it requires not just "enabled" but "enabled AND has some activation mechanism that could match the current context" — would avoid the keyword-extraction work at [line 1271-1281](../core/chat-vectorization.js#L1271-L1281) when a user has enabled lorebooks that aren't locked/triggered for the current chat.

**Why deferred**: A naïve `isLocked`-only gate would break users who rely on **Activation Triggers** or **Advanced Conditions** for activation without ever locking a collection (priorities 2-3 of `shouldCollectionActivate`). The safe shape is `enabled AND (chat-locked OR character-locked OR has triggers OR has conditions)` — a cheap pre-check that matches every activation path. Not worth doing in isolation; revisit if/when we touch Phase B for another reason.

**Caller count**: 1 — `rearrangeChat` is the only place running the EventBase→ChunkBase ordered workflow ([index.js:273](../index.js#L273) is its sole caller via ST's `generate_interceptor`). No util-extraction is needed if/when we change the gate.

**Search tag in code**: none yet. When acted on, target [core/chat-vectorization.js:1247](../core/chat-vectorization.js#L1247) (the `if (!hasCollections && !canQueryWI)` block).

### 16.2 Pre-existing test failures (18 tests across 4 files)

**Status**: Deferred — confirmed pre-existing on `main` before the lorebook WI branch. Not introduced by our changes.

**Bucket 1 — `tests/backends.test.js` (18 tests)**

`vi.mock('../core/providers.js')` in that file doesn't include `getModelFromSettings` in its factory. The function was added to `providers.js` after the mock was written, so any test path that reaches `getModelFromSettings(settings)` throws `[vitest] No "getModelFromSettings" export is defined on the mock`. Fix: add `getModelFromSettings: vi.fn(() => 'mock-model')` to the mock factory.

**Bucket 2 — `tests/backend-manager.test.js`, `tests/hybrid-search.test.js`, `tests/world-info-integration.test.js`**

Vitest tries to resolve ST relative paths (e.g. `../../../../extensions.js`) that live outside the project root, causing module-load failures. Fix options: (a) add `resolve.alias` entries in `vitest.config.js` pointing to stub files, or (b) extract tested logic into ST-free modules the way `lorebook-content-preparer.js` was extracted for the `content-vectorization` tests.
