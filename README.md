## 🎯 What is VectHarePlus?
Branched from the original VectHare project, VectHarePlus is an **advanced Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system** for SillyTavern, now featuring newly added, optimized support for Japanese, Traditional Chinese, and Simplified Chinese.

I branched the original VectHare to handle the massive scale of my personal MVU Game Maker projects, which feature:
- **Extreme scale: 2,000+ replies per story, with 1,000+ words per reply. Summary retrieval returns in less than 3 seconds**
- Non-English language support (Japanese, Traditional/Simplified Chinese).  It supports English by default.
- Strip out all functional tag from MVU Game Maker.

Ordinary SillyTavern memory extensions completely buckle under this load, especially when there are a lot of functional tags reside inside the story used by MVU Game Maker, which is useless for memory lookup.  So, I need something that is able to clean up all these functional tags while maintain high speed vectorization on extreme scale.

Technical Requirement: Because of the high data throughput required, this system relies on a separate Qdrant vector database running via Docker.

### The Problem It Solves

- 😩 Strip out all functional tags used by MVU Game Maker before memory storage.
- 🧠 Adding story based memory on top of character based memory in MVU Game Maker.
- 💸 Long conversations choke your token budget with irrelevant history
- ✍️ You manually edit context to remind characters of key events

**VectHarePlus Solution:** Automatically extract relevant memories from your entire chat history using semantic search, with smart temporal decay that lets older memories fade naturally, and conditional rules to control exactly when memories activate.

## ➕ VectHarePlus Features

### 🌏 Better CJK Language Support
- **Japanese mode** with TinySegmenter-aware extraction behavior
- **Traditional Chinese mode** with Jieba WASM + Traditional dictionary lazy loading
- **Simplified Chinese mode** with Jieba WASM support
- **English, Korean and other Latin language mode** with Intl.Segmenter
- Language-aware keyword filtering with cleaner CJK token handling

### 📝 Summarize Before Store
- Optional summarization before vector storage to reduce noise and improve retrieval density
- Supports OpenRouter and local vLLM-compatible endpoints
- Configurable prompt template so you can tune summary style for your RP format

### ⏯️ Better Vectorization Controls
- **Stop button** in progress flow to halt long-running vectorization tasks
- **Pause/continue style control** for vector content processing workflows
- Improved control over long chat ingestion sessions without restarting everything

### 🔒 Per-Chat Collection Scoping
- Collections are now **scoped to the chat they were vectorized in** — no bleed between different games or characters
- All new vectorizations **auto-activate for the current chat** with no manual setup required
- "Active for current chat" checkbox in Collection Settings directly controls the chat lock (what you see is what you get)
- Lock button in the Database Browser clarifies whether a lock belongs to **this chat** or **another chat**

### 📡 Smarter Status Indicators
- **Auto-Sync card** now shows initialization status: whether the current chat has been vectorized and how many chunks exist
- Auto-Sync guides you to the **Vectorize Content panel** if the chat has not been initialized yet
- **World Info card** shows which lorebooks are currently vectorized by name
- World Info guides you to the lorebook vectorizer if no vectorized lorebooks are found

### 🗂️ Tabbed Interface
- Settings are organized into a clean tabbed layout for easier navigation
- Tabs group related controls together — General, Chat, Retrieval, Collections, Advanced, and more
- Reduces visual clutter compared to a single long settings panel

### ⚡ Message Group Batch Vectorization
- Groups N messages into a batch and summarizes all of them in a **single LLM call**, returning one summary per message
- Batch requests run in **parallel**, making ingestion significantly faster on large chats
- Configurable batch size to balance throughput and LLM context usage
- Ideal for rapid vectorization of long conversations without sacrificing summary quality

### 🧹 Keyword Quality Improvements
- Better single-character filtering defaults for CJK keywords
- Mode-specific exceptions for high-signal 1-character RPG/SoL/school terms
- Better signal-to-noise for multilingual retrieval

### 🔀 Smarter Two-Search Recall (Qdrant)
- VectHarePlus runs **two independent searches**: one using dense vector similarity (semantic meaning), and one using keyword matching against Qdrant payload text and keyword indexes
- It then combines both result lists using RRF or weighted fusion and keeps the best match when duplicates appear
- The keyword search retrieves **every document matching ≥1 query keyword** via Qdrant payload indexes (full corpus scan, no candidate cap — not just the ANN top-K), so keyword-relevant results can surface even with low vector similarity
- If one search returns no results, the other still contributes — memory recall does not fully fail

> ℹ️ **Architecture note:** This is server-side hybrid search implemented in the Similharity plugin, not Qdrant's native dense+sparse-vector hybrid API. No sparse vectors are stored in Qdrant. Keyword matching uses Qdrant payload text indexes and keyword arrays, with RRF/weighted fusion computed in plugin JavaScript.

## ⏳ Temporal Decay System

Memories don't stick around forever. VectHarePlus implements intelligent temporal decay that makes memories naturally fade over time.

### How It Works

**Exponential Decay** (default):
```
relevance = original_score × (0.5 ^ (message_age / half_life))
```

For example, with half-life = 50:
| Messages Ago | Relevance |
|--------------|-----------|
| 0 | 100% |
| 50 | 50% |
| 100 | 25% |
| 150 | 12.5% |

### Configuration Options
- **Enabled**: Toggle decay on/off (default: OFF)
- **Mode**: Exponential or Linear
- **Half-life**: Messages until 50% relevance (default: 50)
- **Floor**: Minimum relevance, prevents complete forgetting (default: 0.3)
- **Temporally Blind**: Mark important chunks to be immune to decay

> 💡 **Pro Tip:** Set a high floor (0.5+) to keep important memories accessible even when old. Mark character introductions as temporally blind!

---

## 🎭 Conditional Activation Rules

Control precisely **when** chunks activate using intelligent rules.

### Rule Types

| Type | Description | Example |
|------|-------------|---------|
| 🎬 **Emotion** | Activate when character feels specific emotion | Activate sad memories when character is sad |
| 🔑 **Keyword** | Activate when keywords appear in chat | Activate "treasure" memories when discussing treasure |
| 📍 **Recency** | Activate only for recent messages | Only use memories from last 10 messages |
| 🎯 **Combined** | Mix multiple conditions with AND/OR | Emotion=happy AND keyword contains "party" |

Supports 28 emotion types with Character Expressions integration!

## 🎯 Pro Tips & Best Practices

### 🧠 Memory Quality
- **Per Message chunks work best** for dialogue-heavy chats
- **Mark scenes for major events** to keep them cohesive
- **Set temporally blind on character intros** so your AI never forgets who people are

### 🚀 Performance
- **Large chats (10k+ messages)?** Use the **Message Group Batch** strategy for fast parallel summarization during ingestion
- **Lower score threshold** if memories aren't being retrieved (try 0.3)

### 🎭 Conditional Activation
- **Pair emotions with Character Expressions** for sprite-based detection
- **Add topic keywords** to make memories context-aware
- **Use recency rules** for time-sensitive information

### 💾 Data Management
- **Export collections regularly** as backups
- **Run diagnostics** if something feels off
- **Check the Database Browser** to see what's actually stored

---

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### "No embeddings available"
1. Enable Vectors extension in main ST settings
2. Select embedding provider in VectHarePlus settings
3. Add API key if using cloud provider
4. Run Diagnostics to verify connectivity

### Chunks not being retrieved
1. Click "Vectorize" button to index current chat
2. Lower score threshold (try 0.3)
3. Check Chunk Visualizer to verify chunks exist
4. Run Diagnostics for detailed health check

### "Backend health check failed"
1. Run Diagnostics to see which backend failed
2. **Qdrant**: Ensure the Qdrant server is running and the Similharity plugin is installed

### Slow performance
1. Switch to the **Message Group Batch** chunking strategy for faster parallel ingestion
2. Increase chunk size (fewer, larger chunks)
3. Reduce query depth and insert count

### Memory forgetting important details
1. Mark important chunks as **temporally blind**
2. Increase the decay floor value
3. Lower score threshold
4. Add conditional activation rules for topic-specific recall
