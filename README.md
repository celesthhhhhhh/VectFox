## 🎯 What is VectHarePlus?

Branched from the original VectHare project, VectHarePlus is an **advanced Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system** for SillyTavern, now featuring newly added, optimized support for Japanese, Traditional Chinese, and Simplified Chinese.

I branched the original VectHare to handle the massive scale of my personal MVU Game Maker projects, which feature:
- **Extreme scale: 2,000+ replies per story, with 1,000+ words per reply. Summary retrieval returns in less than 3 seconds**
- Non-English language support (Japanese, Traditional/Simplified Chinese). It supports English by default.
- Strip out all functional tag from MVU Game Maker.

Ordinary SillyTavern memory extensions completely buckle under this load, especially when there are a lot of functional tags reside inside the story used by MVU Game Maker, which is useless for memory lookup. So, I need something that is able to clean up all these functional tags while maintain high speed vectorization on extreme scale.

Technical Requirement: Because of the high data throughput required, this system relies on a separate Qdrant vector database running via Docker.

### The Problem It Solves

- 😩 Strip out all functional tags used by MVU Game Maker before memory storage.
- 🧠 Adding story based memory on top of character based memory in MVU Game Maker.
- 💸 Long conversations choke your token budget with irrelevant history
- ✍️ You manually edit context to remind characters of key events

**VectHarePlus Solution:** Automatically pull the right memories out of your entire chat history using meaning-based search combined with keyword matching, with smart decay so older memories fade naturally, and rules to control exactly when memories activate.

---

## 🧠 How It Works 

Vector search is like a really smart "find" function. Instead of matching exact words, it matches **meaning** — type "I'm hungry" and it can find a message that said "let's grab lunch" because the *meaning* is similar.

VectHarePlus splits content into two pipelines:

| Pipeline | What it handles |
|---|---|
| **EventBase** | Your **chat history** (live chat + uploaded `.jsonl` archives) |
| **Standard (Chunk)** | Everything else: Lorebook, Character Cards, URLs, documents, wiki pages, YouTube transcripts |

They never see each other's content — so the same chat message can't get retrieved twice.

### What is EventBase? 

Old way: chat gets cut into raw message chunks. The AI searches over the raw text.

EventBase way: an LLM periodically reads recent messages and **summarizes them into structured events** with metadata like importance and who was involved.

If your character had a long shopping trip with Astarion across 50 messages with conversations and other noise that do not help on searching, EventBase might extract one event:

```
{
  description: "Tav and Astarion shopped for armor in Baldur's Gate.
                Astarion mocked the prices. Tav bought a leather chestpiece for 80gp.",
  importance: 0.6,
  source_window: [msg 142 → 154]
}
```

Later when you mention "remember the shopping trip?", VectHarePlus retrieves **the event**, not 50 raw messages. That gives the AI a clean, dense summary instead of a noisy wall of dialogue. Re-running vectorization never re-extracts the same window twice (fingerprint cache).

---

## 🔍 Hybrid Search: A1 vs A2 vs A3 

VectHarePlus combines **two signals** to find the best results:

- **Signal 1 - Vector similarity** — meaning-based ("hungry" matches "let's grab lunch")
- **Signal 2 - BM25 keyword score** — exact word match ("Astarion" matches "Astarion")

There are three paths for combining them, depending on backend and settings:  (From lower end computer to dedicated vector database on a docker)

### A1 — Standard backend + BM25
Browser does a vector search to get the top ~100 candidates, then computes BM25 keyword scores on just those candidates. Simple weighted sum: `α × vectorScore + β × bm25Score`.

**Tradeoff:** Fast and lightweight for slower computer, but if a perfect keyword match was outside the top 100 vector results, it's invisible.

### A2 — Standard backend + Hybrid
Same as A1, but adds:
- **RRF (Reciprocal Rank Fusion)** — combines results by *position* instead of raw score
- **Dual-signal bonus** — results that appear in *both* lists get up to +8% boost

**Example:** Searching "Astarion drinks blood." An event matched by both vector ("vampires/hunger") *and* BM25 (literal "Astarion" + "blood") gets ranked higher than events in only one list.

**Tradeoff:** Better fusion, but still limited to the vector top-K 100 candidate pool.

### A3 — Qdrant native sparse + server-side RRF (best)
Both searches run **inside Qdrant vector database in a single API call**. Each stored point has two vectors: a dense one (meaning) and a sparse one (keyword frequencies). Qdrant computes BM25 weights across the **full corpus** (true IDF, not biased), then fuses with native RRF. The keyword side isn't capped at the dense search's top results — if an event contains your query words, it's eligible, even if its meaning vector wasn't a close match. And the BM25 word-importance weights are calculated using statistics from every event in the database (not just a top-100 sample), so rare words get scored correctly.

**Example:** Searching "I cast Fireball at the dragon." Qdrant searches its dense index (for spell/attack meanings) and sparse index (for the literal words "Fireball" and "dragon") at the same time, fuses server-side, returns one ranked list.

**Tradeoff:** Best accuracy, fastest at scale.

| Backend setting | Path you get |
|---|---|
| Standard (Vectra - standard SillyTavern vector format) + BM25 | A1 |
| Standard (Vectra  - standard SillyTavern vector format) + Hybrid | A2 |
| Qdrant (Dedicated Vector DB on a docker) | A3 |

## ✨ Features

### 🧬 EventBase — LLM-extracted chat memory
LLM summarizes chat into structured events with importance/recency/persistence weights. A 4-weight re-ranker decides what gets injected. Built-in dedup suppresses events already visible in recent messages.

Each event is a structured record, not raw text. Example of what the LLM produces from the Astarion shopping window:

```
event_type:    item_acquired
importance:    6
text:          Tav and Astarion shopped for armor in Baldur's Gate. Astarion mocked the prices.
               Tav bought a leather chestpiece for 80gp.
DateTime:      1492-08-15T14:00:00
cause:         Tav needed better armor before the Gauntlet of Shar expedition
result:        Tav now wears the leather chestpiece; 80gp spent from party funds
characters:    [Tav, Astarion]
locations:     [Baldur's Gate, Sorcerous Sundries district]
factions:      []
items:         [leather chestpiece, 80gp]
concepts:      [armor shopping, party economy]
keywords:      [armor, leather, chestpiece, gold, shopping]
open_threads:  [Gauntlet of Shar preparation]
should_persist: false
```

Both signals (meaning + keywords) operate over this rich field set, so a query like "armor for the dungeon" hits via concepts/open_threads, while "Astarion 80gp" hits via characters/items/keywords.

### 🌏 CJK language support (Japanese, Traditional/Simplified Chinese)
- Jieba WASM (Simplified + Traditional Chinese), TinySegmenter (Japanese), Intl.Segmenter (English/Latin/Korean)
- CJK tokenizer mode is **locked per Qdrant collection** at upsert — switching modes shows a warning modal

### 🔍 Native sparse-vector hybrid search (Qdrant)
A3 path described above — server-side RRF with globally-accurate BM25 IDF. Single round-trip per query.

### 📝 Summarize before store
Mandatory LLM summarization before vector storage. Supports OpenRouter and local vLLM-compatible endpoints. Configurable prompt template.

### ⏯️ Better vectorization controls
Stop button, pause/resume, fingerprint cache that survives Chrome restarts mid-run.

### 🔒 Per-chat collection scoping
New collections auto-activate for the current chat. "Active for current chat" checkbox controls the chat lock. Lock button in the Database Browser shows whether a lock is for *this* chat or another.

### 📡 Smarter status indicators
Auto-Sync card shows whether the current chat is vectorized and how many events exist. World Info card shows vectorized lorebooks by name. Both link to the right vectorizer if something's missing.

### 🗂️ Tabbed interface
Settings split into **Core** (backend, embedding, hybrid), **EventBase** (chat hsitory/archive chat file .jsonl), **ChunkBase** (lorebook/docs/URLs/wiki), **Action** (diagnostics, dev tools).

### ⚡ Parallel Windows — Vectorization Speedup
Vectorizing a long chat normally processes one window at a time: send window 1 to the LLM → wait → embed → send window 2 → wait → embed → ... For a 2000-message chat that's a lot of serialized waiting.

The **Parallel Windows** slider (Chunking Strategy section in Vectorize Content) lets you spawn up to **8 LLM extraction + embedding calls at the same time**. Window 1 is being extracted while windows 2–8 are also in flight, dramatically cutting total ingestion time.

| Slider value | Behavior |
|---|---|
| **1 (safe)** | One window at a time. Lowest provider load, no risk of rate limits, slowest. |
| **2–4** | Mild parallelism. Good middle ground for most providers. |
| **5–8 (fast)** | Aggressive parallelism. Best for cloud providers with high rate limits (OpenRouter, OpenAI, Cohere). May trip rate limits on free tiers. |

Use **1** if you're on a strict rate-limited free tier or a single local GPU. Crank to **8** if you're on a paid cloud provider and want a 2000-message chat ingested in minutes instead of an hour.

### 🧹 Multilingual keyword quality
Better single-character filtering for CJK, mode-specific exceptions for high-signal 1-character RPG/Slice of Life/school terms.

### 🧹 Major cleanup
Scene support was a chunk-based-chat-era feature and has been removed from original VectHare because event base recording have no use of it. Numerous bug fixes around mixed-backend search, handle ID filtering, and diagnostics.

## 🎭 Activation Rules

Each collection card has an Activation panel. The priority chain is:

1. **Disabled** (pause button) → never queries
2. **Triggers** → keywords match recent messages → activates
3. **Advanced Conditions** → if triggers empty/no match, evaluate condition rules → activates 
4. **Active for current chat / Character lock** → manual always-on fallback
5. **Nothing matched** → does not activate

Conditions support emotion (via Character Expressions sprite detection), keywords, message/turn count, and combined AND/OR rules. 

> ⚠️ **CJK note:** Triggers and emotion/keyword conditions are **English-only** — the keyword dictionary is English and regex `\b` word boundaries don't fire between CJK characters. For Chinese/Japanese/Korean stories, use **"Active for current chat" / Character lock** instead. Message Count / Turn Count conditions are numeric and work fine for any language.

---

## ⏳ Temporal Decay

Older content gets a lower score so it only surfaces when really relevant.

```
relevance = original_score × (0.5 ^ (message_age / half_life))
```

With half-life = 50: a message 50 ago is at 50% relevance, 100 ago at 25%, 150 ago at 12.5%. Floor (default 0.3) prevents complete forgetting. Mark important chunks **temporally blind** to make them immune.

> **EventBase note:** EventBase has its own built-in recency bonus in the 4-weight re-ranker. The standalone decay setting only affects non-chat content (lorebook, documents).

---

## 📦 Backends

| Backend | Best for | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| **Standard (Vectra - SillyTavern default vector format)** | Small datasets, multilingual, getting started | No dependencies. Limited to A1/A2 hybrid. |
| **Qdrant** | Large chats, multilingual, production | A3 hybrid (best accuracy). Requires Qdrant + Similharity plugin (installation below). |

Use **Qdrant vector database** for any ultra fast and accurate delopment — A3 is materially more accurate than A1/A2, especially for CJK, and it is free and opensource.  2000+ events in the database takes 1.5 seconds round trip search.

## ❓ FAQ

**Can I change the CJK Tokenizer Mode mid-chat?**
No — don't do it. The CJK Tokenizer Mode is **locked into each Qdrant collection at upsert time** via a sentinel point. Switching modes after you've already vectorized content will trigger a "Tokenizer mismatch" warning modal on the next query, and your only real options are:
1. **Revert** to the original mode (preserve existing vectors), or
2. **Re-vectorize the collection from scratch** with the new mode (throw away all extracted events and start over).

Pick your tokenizer mode *before* you start vectorizing a chat and stick with it. There's no in-place migration — sparse vectors were tokenized with the original mode, so they're incompatible with a different tokenizer's output.

**Why is EventBase ignoring my temporal decay setting?**
EventBase has its own built-in recency bonus baked into the 4-weight re-ranker. The standalone temporal decay setting only applies to non-chat content (lorebook, documents). This is intentional — applying both would double-decay chat events.

**Can I use triggers/emotion conditions on Chinese/Japanese/Korean chats?**
Not reliably. The keyword dictionary is English-only and regex `\b` word boundaries don't fire between CJK characters. Use "Active for current chat" / Character lock instead, or numeric Message Count / Turn Count conditions.

**Why are some of my old "scene" settings being ignored?**
Scene support was removed (it was a chunk-based-chat-era feature, and chat now runs through EventBase). Saved `isScene` / `sceneAware` fields are silently ignored — no migration needed, they'll rot out as you re-vectorize.

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

**"No embeddings available"** — Enable Vectors extension in main ST settings, select an embedding provider, add API key if needed, run Diagnostics.

**Events/chunks not retrieved** — Click Vectorize to index, lower the score threshold (try 0.3), confirm the collection is "Active for current chat" or has matching triggers.

**"Backend health check failed"** — On Qdrant, make sure the Qdrant server is running and the Similharity plugin is installed.

**Slow performance** — Switch to Qdrant + A3 (single round-trip, server-side fusion). Reduce EventBase Top K. Use API embedding providers (parallel) instead of local GPU (sequential).

**Memory forgetting important details** — Mark important chunks temporally blind, raise the decay floor, add trigger keywords (English content only).
